Clikt *(pronounced "clicked")* is a multiplatform Kotlin library that makes writing command line
interfaces simple and intuitive. It's the "Command Line Interface for Kotlin".

It is designed to make the process of writing command line tools effortless
while supporting a wide variety of use cases and allowing advanced
customization when needed.

Clikt has:

 * arbitrary nesting of commands
 * composable, type safe parameter values
 * generation of help output and shell autocomplete scripts
 * multiplatform packages for JVM, Node.js, and native Linux, Windows and macOS 

What does it look like? Here's a complete example of a simple Clikt program:

```kotlin
class Hello : CliktCommand() {
    val count: Int by option().int().default(1).help("Number of greetings")
    val name: String by option().prompt("Your name").help("The person to greet")

    override fun run() {
        repeat(count) {
            echo("Hello $name!")
        }
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) = Hello().main(args)
```

And here's what it looks like when run:
