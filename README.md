Clikt *(pronounced "clicked")* is a Kotlin library that makes writing
command line interfaces simple and intuitive. It's the "Command Line
Interface for Kotlin".

Inspired by Python's [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click), it is
designed to make the process of writing command line tools efortless
while supporting a wide variety of use cases and allowing advanced
customization when needed.

Clikt has:

 * arbitrary nesting of commands
 * composable, type safe parameter values
 * support for a wide variety of command line interface styles

 What does it look like? Here's a complete example of a simple Clikt
 program:

```kotlin
class Hello : CliktCommand() {
    val count: Int by option(help="Number of greetings").int().default(1)
    val name: String by option(help="The person to greet").prompt("Your name")

    override fun run() {
        for (i in 1..count) {
            echo("Hello $name!")
        }
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) = Hello().main(args)
```

 And here's what it looks like when run:

```
 $ ./hello --count=3
 Your name: John
 Hello John!
 Hello John!
 Hello John!
```

The help page is generated for you:

```
$ ./hello --help
Usage: hello [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --count INT  Number of greetings
  --name TEXT  The person to greet
  -h, --help   Show this message and exit
```

Errors are also taken care of:

```
$ ./hello --whoops
Usage: hello [OPTIONS]

Error: no such option: "--whoops".
```
